I"£<p>Since moving to Northern Europe, Iâ€™ve been obsessed with trying to maximize my exposure to light, especially during the winter. Oddly enough, Iâ€™ve since been experimenting trying to spend more time in the dark.</p>

<p>This all got started listening to <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/06/13/podcast-312-disappearing-night-sky/">Paul Bogard talk about his book <em>The End of Night</em></a>. His premise is that we have very little exposure to true darkness anymore, and weâ€™re losing something with more than sentimental value.</p>

<p>For over a year now, Iâ€™ve been experimenting with not always having the lights on in the evening. I use nightshift on my computer and phone plus use darker themes anyway. In the winter if I really need some light towards the late evening, candles usually do the trick. Thereâ€™s a certain warm glow that just plain nice from orangish light anyway. Iâ€™m not neurotic about any of thisâ€”Iâ€™ll turn on the light if need it, but try to keep it to a minimum after I get home from work.</p>

<p>The results have been noticeable: Iâ€™m more tired at bedtime and either my night vision has improved or Iâ€™m better at using other senses to compensate for not seeing as well. Iâ€™m more in tune with seasonal cycles, meaning that Iâ€™m ok with six hours of sleep during short summer nights, yet naturally gravitate closer to nine during the long dark nights of winter.</p>

<p>Another surprise is that my body is also shifting to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep#Interrupted_sleep">biphasic sleep</a> on its own accord. If I had my druthers, Iâ€™d sleep from nine to one and then from three to seven. This, obviously, makes a normal social life all but impossible. My compromise is nine hours in bed with a one hour break during the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not for turning back the clock and pretending to live in a pre-modern society. Still, with a few hacks we can trick our bodies into being a lot closer to that state, which is likely where they function best.</p>

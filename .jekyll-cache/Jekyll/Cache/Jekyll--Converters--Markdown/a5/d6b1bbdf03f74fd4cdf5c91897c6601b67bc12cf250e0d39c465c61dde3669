I"è<p>I like Apple products, even if Iâ€™m not a <em>bona fide</em> fanboy. Iâ€™m willing to pay more for a product that lasts longer and doesnâ€™t show me a constant stream of ads. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not interested in Google or Amazon devices. As much as a Surface Pro temps me, the idea of ads embedded in the OS is too off putting for me to even consider Windows.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, look what Appleâ€™s doing in iOSâ€™s Books App.</p>

<p>When you leave a book that youâ€™re currently reading, by default youâ€™re taken to this new â€˜Reading Nowâ€™ page, which is essentially an ad platform for buying Apple Books. As far as I can tell, thereâ€™s no way to override this setting and go straight to your library.</p>

<p>I mean, this isnâ€™t a deal breaker, and itâ€™s certainly not worse than whatâ€™s lurking on literally every other OS out there. Nonetheless, itâ€™s disappointing. Apple, you can do better, and thatâ€™s precisely why you have so many loyal customers willing to pay premium prices.</p>

<p>More generally, Iâ€™m tired of seeing ads after Iâ€™ve paid for something. Not long ago I took a taxi that had tablets with ads blaring the whole ride. Every square inch of the Bangkok metro was devoted to selling something or other. Truly non-commercial spaces have become nearly impossible to find.</p>

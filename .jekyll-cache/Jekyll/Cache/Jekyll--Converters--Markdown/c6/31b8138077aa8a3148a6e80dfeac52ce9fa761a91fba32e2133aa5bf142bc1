<p>Saying yes and no is surprisingly difficult in English, and Iâ€™ve seen many misunderstandings between native-speakers and non-native-speakers.</p>

<p><em>Letâ€™s go out for dinner tonight.    <br />
Donâ€™t we have food at home? <br />
Yes / No</em></p>

<p>I donâ€™t know about you, but I have no idea what either yes or no mean here. This example shows why many languages (including English!) donâ€™t actually use a two-form affirmation / negation system. English used to have a four-form system:</p>

<p><em>Do we have any food at home?</em> [positive question]<br />
<em>Yea</em> [affirmative] / <em>Nay</em> [negative]<br />
<em>Donâ€™t we have food at home?</em> [negative question]<br />
<em>Yes</em> [we have food at home]<br />
<em>No</em> [we donâ€™t have food at home]</p>

<p>Yea and nay survive in the modern English as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossilization_%28linguistics%29">fossilized forms</a>, so they donâ€™t help clear up the yes or no problem in modern English.</p>

<p>German has a three-form system:</p>

<p><em>Haben wir Essen zu Hause?</em><br />
<em>Ja / Nein</em> [as in English]<br />
<em>Haben wir kein Essen zu Hause?</em><br />
<em>Doch</em> [we have food at home]<br />
<em>Nein</em> [we donâ€™t have food at home]</p>

<p>Chinese doesnâ€™t have the words yes and no at all; an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_answer">echo answer</a> is used:</p>

<p>æˆ‘ä»¬åœ¨å®¶æœ‰é£Ÿç‰©å—? [positive question]<br />
æœ‰ [literally: have]<br />
æ²¡æœ‰ [literally: not have]</p>

<p>Turning it into a negative question makes no difference in the clarity of the answer:<br />
æˆ‘ä»¬åœ¨å®¶æ²¡æœ‰é£Ÿç‰©å—? [negative question]  <br />
æœ‰ [literally: have]<br />
æ²¡æœ‰ [literally: not have]</p>

<p>In fact, the most common way to ask the question in Chinese is to use both the negative and positive form, from which the echo answer logically flows:  <br />
æˆ‘ä»¬åœ¨å®¶æœ‰æ²¡æœ‰é£Ÿç‰©?<br />
[literally: We at home have donâ€™t have food?]</p>

<p>Spoken English makes extensive use of echo answers in addition to and sometimes in place of yes or no. This is likely a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittonicisms_in_English">borrowing from the Celtic languages</a> that were present in Britain before the arrival of Germanic speakers.</p>

<p>The issue brought up in the first example would unlikely occur between two native-speakers. A native-speaker would respond:
<em>Donâ€™t we have food at home?</em> [negative question]<br />
<em>Yes, we do.</em>  <br />
<em>No, we donâ€™t.</em></p>

<p>Hence, my advice for non-native speakers is to <u>always</u> use an echo response with negative questions. In general, use them to add emphasis or make your speech sound more natural and understandable.</p>

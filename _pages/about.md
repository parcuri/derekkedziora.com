I’m a writer in the tech industry. Take your pick of content designer, UX writer, technical writer or copywriter. 

My background is in linguistics and teaching English as a foreign language was my first career. 

I’m a geek with too many gadgets but have a soft spot for digital minimalism and the analog world.  

Outside of work I’m putzing around with tech stuff, reading a book or riding my bike. 

I’m something between a Stoic and a Buddhist, and started meditating before the current mindfulness bonanza. 

I live in Kyiv, Ukraine but am originally from Phoenix, Arizona with a few stops along the way.

## Social without Social Media 

Running a small-scale blog brings back a tiny part of [the web we lost](https://anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/). One of my favorite things about this is when people stumble across my blog and then reach out to me. I've had some great conversations about programming, travel, life in Ukraine and meditation.

I started this site in 2016 as a way to digitize my lessons as an English teacher. It's since grown around my interests in tech, writing, meditation and my stack of books. 

I use  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build a static site that's served over [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Want to peak under the hood? [Check out my source code](https://github.com/derekkedziora/derekkedziora.com). 

My goals are speed, simplicity and longevity. Thus, my site is static HTML, CSS and a few JavaScript progressive enhancements. I can only scratch my head at using the JS framework *du jour* to serve up blog posts.    

I’m keeping an eye on John Sundell’s [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish). If this can someday work on Swift Playgrounds on an iPad, I’m sold. 

## Useful Things I’ve Built 

My most popular blog post in organic search results is about adding a [dark mode toggle](/blog/dark-mode-revisited). 

Another popular feature that sees a fair amount of traffic and I get asked about a lot is my [random post link](/blog/Getting-Random-Post-in-Jekyll). 

## Typography 

I’m a typography nerd. If you haven’t done so already, any person who produces any writing needs to buy [Butterick’s Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com). 

I don’t agree with everything Butterick writes. I'm often on slow internet so not a huge fan of having to load fonts. 

If you're on an Apple device, you're seeing Iowan Old Style. Everybody else, you're stuck with Georgia.

It’s a constant struggle to stay informed and discover new ideas without information overload. 

Following a few good blogs and podcasts gives me a far better view than chasing up-to-the-second headlines. 

## Blogosphere 

[No Mercy / No Malice](https://www.profgalloway.com) by Scott Galloway.<br>
A healthy dose of tech and free market scepticism without a far left agenda. [Direct link to the RSS feed](https://api.profgalloway.com/feed/). 

[Seth Godin's Blog](https://seths.blog) is worth a read for anyone who writes, and by extension tells stories. 

[Signal v. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com) by Basecamp.<br>
 Yes, there’s a lot of self-promotion, but there’s also a lot of good stuff about office culture and tech. 

[Brad Frost’s blog](https://bradfrost.com) hits all the things I like about web design: accessibility, semantic HTML, having fun with CSS and not going overboard with JS. The dual designer-developer perspective is quickly becoming a thing of the past.

[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net) has tech news, politics and random tidbits. 

## Podcasts 

I listen to ~10% of the episodes in my feed, but I've really come to appreciate a good, long podcast. 

[Stoic Meditations](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stoic-meditations/id1328933559) is short, to the point and just what I need most days. 

[Making Sense by Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/podcast/) covers the stuff I like: meditation, philosophy, politics.

[The Joe Rogan Experience](http://podcasts.joerogan.net) has some great shows and many complete    flops. 

I listen to [the Tim Ferris Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/) for the guests. 

[The Portal](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-portal/id1469999563) has it's moments but really depends on the guest. 

## Twitter 

If you're not having fun on Twitter, you're not doing it right. 

[@flightrader](https://twitter.com/flightradar24) for general aviation buffs.

[@shedd_aquarium](https://twitter.com/shedd_aquarium) has penguins. Enough said. 

[@pinboard](https://twitter.com/pinboard) to stay abreast of the big-bookmarking world.

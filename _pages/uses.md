No affiliate links. Just stuff that I like and use. 

## Hardware

**Tablet**: 3rd generation iPad air. Great device that I do most of my reading a good chunk of my writing on. 

I tried to do the whole iPad only thing. It's not there yet. Even basic programming requires a bunch of hacks. Really complex things (like doing taxes) need a big screen. 

**Computer**: I'm coasting off of my work computer for now. I'm eying one of the 2020 MacBook Airs though. 

I used to pluck my laptop on a desk and pluck away at it. Get a stand. Seriously. I have a Rain Design mStand and use a magic keyboard and trackpad. 

**Phone**: iPhone XR. My first *big* phone. No complaints. 

**Watch**: Series 3 Apple Watch. More toy than serious tool, but I do find the health tracking useful. 

## Software 

[News Explorer](https://betamagic.nl/products/newsexplorer.html) is the best RSS reader out there and totally underrated. iCloud sync means I don't need to use Feedly or another third party. 

[Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com) is my read it later app. Complete iCloud sync is the reason I use it, since it is lacking on features compared to Instapaper and Pocket (no tagging, folders or search).

Window snapping is bizarrely absent on Mac OS. [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) does the trick. 

[Byword](https://bywordapp.com) is my go-to markdown editor on the Mac, [iA writer](https://ia.net/writer) on the iPad.

I love [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), because it's great for the light coding and text manipulation that I do. Most importantly, it's *not* an electron app.

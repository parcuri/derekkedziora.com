English has a complex system of marking whether something was observed:

> *It rained.* 

This means that I saw it rain. Or

> *It must have rained*

This is a conclusion. I'm nearly certain that it rained, because it is cloudy and the sidewalk is wet]. The degree of certainty can be modified by switching out must for may or could.

It is more natural to show this information through modal verbs than adverbs of probability such as certainly, probably or definitely. This can be seen by looking at the [ngrams][0] comparing probably rained, certainly rained and must have rained.

This is also why opinions aren't explicitly marked by phrases such as *in my opinion*, *to my mind* or *I think* that often in English. A modal verb automatically tells the listener you are stating an opinion and your level of certainty. While the sentence *In my opinion, it definitely rained* isn't a mistake, it sounds far more natural to say *It must have rained*.

The following story illustrates the context that various modals can be used in:  

`1.` Let's say you went to bed one evening in January and noticed that there was no snow on the ground.

> _Fantastic! There **shouldn't** be any problems with traffic on the way to work tomorrow._

`2.` Unfortunately for you, when you woke the next morning you saw a thick covering of snow.  

> _Uh-oh, it **must have** snowed last night_  

`3.` You decided to take the subway to work rather than driving.   

> _The subway **has to** be running since it is underground. It **must** be unaffected by the bad weather._

`4.` When you got to the station and were about to pay for your fare, you realized that you didn't have your wallet.      

> _I **might have** left it at home or my wife **may have** accidentally put it in her purse._

`5.` It's nearly impossible, but:      

> _It **could have** been stolen._

`6.` Rather than worry about your wallet, you decided to sneak onto the subway without a ticket. When you finally got to the office, your friends are shocked and said:   
> _You **might have** been caught. You **could have** been arrested._

`7.` One of your co-workers knows you better than the rest and realizes that you love jokes and exaggerating a bit.  

> _You **can't** be serious. You **mustn't** be telling the truth since you have a reputation for telling tall tales!_  

## Notes

`1.` **should + [do], shouldn't + [do]**  
*Should* or *shouldn't* is used for a highly probable future event. The sentence *He should be on time for the meeting.* means that there is a high probability that he will be on time for the meeting rather than he ought to be on time for the meeting.

`2.` **must have + [done], must not have + [done]**  
*Must have* shows that you have made a conclusion about a past event and are nearly certain. This can **never** mean a past obligation. For that we use *had to*. For example: *Tony had to study for the exam because he wanted to get a good grade* (obligation) vs. *Tony must have studied for the exam because he got a good grade* (inference based on evidence).

`3.` **[have / has] to + [do], must + [do]**  
These equivalent structures show a conclusion about a present situation and need to be distinguished from obligation. *Lisa must be at the office since she's not home* (inference) vs. *Lisa must be at the office, because her boss won't let her go home early.* (obligation). In the present these have the same form but use different past forms: *Lisa must have been at the office this morning since she wasn't at home* vs. *Lisa had to stay at the office late, because her boss wouldn't let her go home early*.

`4.` **might have [done], may have [done]**  
These structures have the same meaning: a conclusion has been reached about a past even with less certainty than *must have*.

`5.` **could have [done]**  
This shows an even lower probability for a past even than *might have*.

`6.` **could have [done], might have [done]**  
*Might have* and *could have* carry a different meaning than those in points four and five. In this meaning a possible past event that didn't occur is described. It is important to distinguish this from point four since *may have* cannot be used here. For example, a mother has found out that her son was playing with matches and yells that *he could have burned down the whole house and might have even killed himself*.

`7.` **can't [do], mustn't [do]**  
These structures show that a present situation is impossible. Note the difference between can't / mustn't showing an inference and the same words showing ability or prohibition. *He can't [must not] be in a good after he missed lunch.* (inference) vs. *He can't [must not] run in the marathon due to his doctor's orders* (ability [prohibition]). The first example takes this form in the past: *He couldn't [must not] have been in a good mood after he had missed lunch.* while the second would be *He couldn't [wasn't allowed to] run in the marathon due to his doctor's orders.*

- [Evidentiality][3] is the formal term in linguistics for stating various levels of certainty.    
- Some languages in the Balkan [Sprachbund][4] have a completely separate verbal form to mark uncertain and reported information known as the [inferential mood][5]. This is more or less equivalent to the *must have* structure in English.
